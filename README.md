# Diwali Sales Data Analysis Using Python

This project involves analyzing a dataset of customer demographics and purchase behavior during the Diwali season. The primary goal is to uncover insights that can inform business decisions and optimize marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: 11,251 records with 13 attributes, including customer details, product categories, and sales amounts.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Objective**: To analyze customer behavior, sales patterns, and product preferences during the Diwali sales period.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and optimized data types for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identified key customer segments (e.g., **female customers** and the **35-45 age group**) that contributed the most to sales.
  - Analyzed sales trends across different states and occupations.
  - Visualized product category performance to identify top-selling products.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Created visualizations with Seaborn to illustrate sales by **gender**, **age group**, **state**, and **product category**.
  - Highlighted the dominance of the **Automobile product category** during Diwali sales.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Imported dataset using Pandas.
   - Cleaned data by dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
   - Optimized data types for better performance.
   
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Performed statistical analysis to summarize key metrics such as average sales, order count, and customer demographics.
   - Identified the top-selling product categories and high-performing regions.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generated bar plots for gender, age group, state, and product category.
   - Analyzed total sales by each demographic to extract meaningful trends.

## Key Insights
- **Female customers** and individuals aged **35-45** contributed significantly to total sales.
- The **Automobile category** was the highest-performing product category during the Diwali season.
- States like **Maharashtra** and **Andhra Pradesh** showed the highest number of orders and sales amounts.

## Technologies Used
